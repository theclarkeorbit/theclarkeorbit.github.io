<p>It was the monsoon of 1999.</p>
<p>I stood there in my first, never-shaved moustache and navy blue uniform, cold despite the blazer and the multitudes who stood silently around me, 'at ease'. My eyes were moist. The Principal spoke on for a while but I was not really listening, because you see, I was a patriot and a dreamer, and just then, I was lost in visions of erudite men in kahkis who could shoot straight in hard places and fight for the country when they were not writing poetry, observing birds or dining with charming ladies. A small town Indian patriot in 1999 who could only dream in the idiom of an English schoolboy from 1899. </p>
<p>Empire is a curious thing. </p>
<p>And I loved the Empire. My central board history books were filled with accounts of Heroes of the independence movement and the atrocities of the British and I was suitably moved by the sacrifices of the freedom fighters and shocked by the brutality and unfairness of the colonial regime but - and I only admit it to myself now - my loyalties lay firmly with the empire builders. How do I know this ? Because in my day dreams I was never a revolutionary or even an Indian. I was always a scientist/explorer, implicitly European, privileged, male. </p>                </article>
