<p>A ghastly grim and ancient problem,<br />
I landed on its crowded shore,<br />
A cheery well meaning outsider,<br />
Ignorant of what lay in store,<br />
Now stuck with it,<br />&nbsp;Forevermore.</p>
<p>Old unpopular difficult useless,<br />
Such is the bleakness I explore,<br />
Coding simulating and plotting,<br />
Bored to my very core,<br />
What could I do ?<br />
Something&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>A question first asked in the 60s,<br />
50 years of speculations galore,<br />
Theorized experimented and published,<br />
Many many many times o&#8217;er,<br />
Still I fiddled with it,<br />
Why and what for&nbsp;?</p>
<p>But eventually I formed a theory,<br />
Dallied with data, bored and bleary,<br />
Broken up beaten tired and teary,<br />
Even lonelier than I was before,<br />
Social life peaking,<br />
At the Indian&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>When first the data matched my theory,<br />
I was elated, but I saw it clearly,<br />
Noisy marginal debatable dreary,<br />
But it fit my theory, I wanted no more !<br />
So I swallowed my doubts,<br />&nbsp;Forevermore.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Publish !&#8221; Said I, &#8220;Lets send this away !,<br />
I&#8217;m done with it ! Not one more day !<br />
I&#8217;m sick and tired, please hear what I say,<br />
Here is an obscure journal people ignore.&#8221;<br />
Quoth the advisor,<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s its impact score&nbsp;?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We have a good story, so lets aim high !<br />
It&#8217;s unlikely, but lets shoot for the sky !&#8221;<br />
Dejected, I quietly watched hope die,<br />
Drowning, swept rapidly from shore,<br />
Stuck in academia,<br />
Staring at the&nbsp;door.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Publish !&#8221; Said I &#8220;please take my paper !<br />
You carry nonsense of similar stature,<br />
You are <span class="caps">PNAS</span>, not Science or Nature !&#8221;<br />
But even they sent it back once more,<br />
Depression was normal,<br />
Failure, a&nbsp;chore.</p>
<p>Papers - like everything - eventually pass,<br />
But I&#8217;m working on the next one, alas !<br />
With my heart of clay and ego of glass,<br />
Drama ? There is plenty of that in store,<br />
I still love science,<br />
Looking for a&nbsp;cure.</p>
<p>Depressed impostors, working all night,<br />
Searching for knowledge, yearning for light,<br />
Mostly on youtube, pretending to write,<br />
Soaking up irrelevant scientific lore,<br />
For the world is wonderful,<br />
And work is a&nbsp;bore.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I find as my PhD ends,<br />
I&#8217;ve plumbed the depths but I&#8217;ve made amends,<br />
Thanks to support from family and friends,<br />
The daemons I carry are easy to ignore,<br />
And for this I&#8217;m thankful,<br />&nbsp;Forevermore.</p>
