</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;ve checked&#8221;, the Principal said one morning at assembly &#8220;The hill behind the school does not seem to have a name. In the memory of those who died in Kashmir, we will call it Tiger Hill. So that we never&nbsp;forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the monsoon of 1999. I stood there in my first, never-shaved moustache and navy blue uniform, cold despite the blazer and the multitudes who stood silently around me, &#8216;at ease&#8217;. My eyes were moist. The Principal spoke on for a while but I was not really listening. Because you see, I was a patriot and a dreamer and just then, I was lost in visions of erudite men in khakis who could shoot straight in hard places and fight for the country when they were not writing poetry, observing birds or dining with charming ladies. A small town Indian patriot in 1999 who could only dream in the idiom of an English schoolboy from&nbsp;1899. </p>
<p>Empire is a curious&nbsp;thing. </p>
<p>And I loved the Empire. My central board history books were filled with accounts of Heroes of the independence movement and the atrocities of the British and I while was suitably moved by the sacrifices of the freedom fighters and shocked by the brutality and unfairness of the colonial regime, (and I admit it to myself only now) my loyalties lay firmly with the empire builders. How do I know this ? Because in my daydreams I was never a revolutionary or even an Indian. I was always a scientist/explorer, implicitly European, privileged,&nbsp;male. </p>
<p>In the years before this, before our Principal baptized the hill, before my moustache and my long pants, the hill was my first haunt outside the city. One could cycle from my house past the dargah and the unguarded railway crossing and into the wide open countryside. Golden-brown in summer - the dry grass shimmering in the hot wind - emerald green come the monsoon. We would ride out on cycles too big for us, in the rain, past the rushing streams in their little canyons and the tiny crabs clambering over bare rock, riding out to the mist covered hills that dominated the horizon. We rarely got very far though, the mud that clogged up our wheels combined with the hunger that was ever gnawing at our young, rapidly growing bodies always ensured we were at our homes well in time for the next&nbsp;meal. </p>
<p>Occasionally, we would make it all the way to school and the hill. It is the sort of hill commonly seen on the Deccan, with a one dimensional summit - long and thin. This particular hill also tapered toward the back giving it the appearance of a Sphinx with its head lopped off. And if you stood where the head might have been, you could see the city in the far distance and the hills on the other side. Some with a masjid on top, some with temples, sometimes even a tree to liven up the flat, shaven countryside. And directly below you - at your feet - the school, with its fields and buildings arranged in a wide arc. The wind carried even soft voices all the way to the top of the hill so that you heard them clearly but could not understand what they were saying. Sheep and cows grazing on the hillside, the occasional tinkling of a bell, it was&nbsp;beautiful.</p>
<p>And it made me want to&nbsp;leave.</p>
<p>To seek out other, more beautiful places and other, less familiar people. To go away seemed a worthy end in itself, away into a world full of wonder and mystery and discovery. On the one hand Haggard and Doyle and Stevenson and Defoe invited me to find blanks on the map - rough seas and fierce natives, mysterious artefacts and legends of treasure while Clarke invited me to a more civilized world, no less marvelous - exploration and adventure via international scientific bureaucracy. If the patriotism of my childhood was fired by stories of Englishmen who walked into the sunset with stiff upper lips, the yearning of my adolescent years was certainly toward the gentle, optimistic, post-national scientific endeavors described by&nbsp;Clarke.</p>
<p>I remember passing through Kargil a few years after leaving my school and my little city on the Deccan. Our car stopped, a short walk away from the base of the real, original Tiger Hill. Massive, menacing, unbelievably close to the national highway. I wonder how many Indian army men died there, storming the steep, steep slopes in the darkness in a hail of bullets to drive the insurgents from their entrenched positions. The Light Brigade could hardly have been more valiant. And Tiger Hill was only one of hundreds of such peaks that the Indian army stormed, young officers leading from the front, dying shortly after <span class="caps">TV</span> interviews. As one of them famously said, &#8220;Yeh dil maange more&nbsp;!&#8221;. </p>
<p>I felt it keenly then, my Indian-ness. Here, a range of lofty and blood stained mountains that separates my country from another, very different one. There, above Siachen is Indira Col, a watershed. A drop of water on this side will flow into the Indus, onto the bustling Indian sub-continent. A drop of water on the other side flows into Central Asia to cities like Kashgar, Khokand, Bokhara, broad, empty plains cut by high mountains, verdant valleys and old old caravan routes and those ancient rivers, the Amu and Syr Darya. A very different country. It was - is - my dream go there. To the Pamir Knot - the roof of the world. Even here, surrounded by the bullet holes of a recent war and stirring stories of soldiers recently dead, my patriotism was one that goaded me to cross the border, to see myself and my country from afar. To feel its absence, perhaps to reassure myself that I loved it and perhaps that some of it loved me&nbsp;back. </p>
<p>The last man landed on the moon over a decade before I was born, and it seems unlikely that humanity will go anywhere in the next 50 years. But, even our age is not without its attractions. The efforts to understand biology and disease using math and science might lay to rest some more of our oldest enemies, private companies are rushing into space, even if only just beyond the atmosphere and millions of people from formerly deprived nations now find a voice in the global cacophony. Despite this - and despite having participated in some of it - I remain discomfited. I do not wish to remain. The yearning to leave is still as&nbsp;strong. </p>
<p>To settle down anywhere but India will be to become of that place and my patriotism will not allow that. But my patriotism does not countenance a return either, since it is a patriotism of absence and nostalgia, of being far away, a patriotism that wants to yearn to be home, but does not want to be at home. I even remember the exact moment - sometime in middle school - when I decided what kind of person I wanted to be, even though it is only now that I realize its significance. In 2010:Odyssey Two the narrator describes Dr. Chandra as having &#8220;an educated Indian accent&#8221;. And as I read those words, I knew that someday I would be a dislocated Indian surrounded by foreigners, but (hopefully) with an &#8220;educated Indian accent&#8221;. The idea had an unbearable&nbsp;attraction. </p>
<p>I never dreamt of Englishmen staying back home and doing good works in the countryside. No, my dreams were, are and have always been about people who went away. Like those soldiers on Tiger Hill and Gandamak went away, like Alain Quartermain and Robinson Crusoe and David Bowman went away. Almost as if I want to reinforce my Indian-ness, by surrounding myself with the un-Indian and&nbsp;unfamiliar.</p>
<p>And so I must keep moving, traveling, relocating, relearning. There is nothing else I have ever dreamt of doing, little else I wish to do. Until something fills the hole in my heart that my longing for India occupies, and finally allows me to go&nbsp;home. </p>
