A ghastly grim and ancient problem,  
I landed on its crowded shore,  
A cheery well meaning outsider,  
Ignorant of what lay in store,  
Now stuck with it,  
Forevermore.

Old unpopular difficult useless,  
Such is the bleakness I explore,  
Coding simulating and plotting,  
Bored to my very core,  
What could I do ?  
Something more.

A question first asked in the 60s,  
50 years of speculations galore,  
Theorized experimented and published,  
Many many many times o'er,  
Still I fiddled with it,  
Why and what for ?

But eventually I formed a theory,  
Dallied with data, bored and bleary,  
Broken up beaten tired and teary,  
Even lonelier than I was before,  
Social life peaking,  
At the Indian store.

When first the data matched my theory,  
I was elated, but I saw it clearly,  
Noisy marginal debatable dreary,  
But it fit my theory, I wanted no more !  
So I swallowed my doubts,  
Forevermore.

"Publish !" Said I, "Lets send this away !,  
I'm done with it ! Not one more day !  
I'm sick and tired, please hear what I say,  
Here is an obscure journal people ignore."  
Quoth the advisor,  
"What's its impact score ?"

"We have a good story, so lets aim high !  
It's unlikely, but lets shoot for the sky !"  
Dejected, I quietly watched hope die,  
Drowning, swept rapidly from shore,  
Stuck in academia,  
Staring at the door.

"Publish !" Said I "please take my paper !  
You carry nonsense of similar stature,  
You are PNAS, not Science or Nature !"  
But even they sent it back once more,  
Depression was normal,  
Failure, a chore.

Papers - like everything - eventually pass,  
But I'm working on the next one, alas !  
With my heart of clay and ego of glass,  
Drama ? There is plenty of that in store,  
I still love science,  
Looking for a cure.

Depressed impostors, working all night,  
Searching for knowledge, yearning for light,  
Mostly on youtube, pretending to write,  
Soaking up irrelevant scientific lore,  
For the world is wonderful,  
And work is a bore.

Surprisingly, I find as my PhD ends,  
I've plumbed the depths but I've made amends,  
Thanks to support from family and friends,  
The daemons I carry are easy to ignore,  
And for this I'm thankful,  
Forevermore.
