## Getting data

For this post, we will use data from a [recent kaggle contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/probabilistic-forecasting-i-temperature/) on probabilistic time series prediction. With a free Kaggle API, the data can be downloaded via the cli with `kaggle competitions download -c probabilistic-forecasting-i-temperature`.
